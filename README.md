# FPA designer
FPA designer computes aeodynamics and structure for low-speed airplane. This application have the following characteristics.

- Estimate lift, drag, and pitching moment using lifting line theory or vortex lattice method, which is selected by each user.
- Estimate the weight of airplane using the statistics of human-powered airplane.
- Calculate equilibrium of the airplane by solving 3DOF equation of motion.
- Optimize airplane shape.
